When you enter ~http://localhost:3002~ in your browser, you should see something like this:

*** How to generate a new Bitcoin address

**** Preconditions    

 * BTC testnet shell is open (see step 1 of the section *How to check balance* on how to do this).

**** Process

Run ~bitcoin-cli getnewaddress~ in the BTC testnet shell.

The output will be something like ~2N5Yngd2nDX4pur3Wec9WeL4xmSvBCyMsqi~.

*** How to generate test Bitcoins

**** Preconditions    

 * BTC testnet shell is open (see step 1 of the section *How to check balance* on how to do this).

**** Process

***** Step 1: Check balance

See section *How to check the balance* above. Note the amount.
      
***** Step 2: Generate test Bitcoins
     
~bitcoin-cli generatetoaddress 200 <address>~

where ~<address>~ is the address you generated with ~bitcoin-cli getnewaddress~.

***** Step 3: Check the balance again

This time it should be larger than at step 1.
